# cheap_flight_search
Program that searchs for cheap flights to different locations and sends an email with the flights detail.

I've built this project for a Python course that I am doing and i'm very proud as it is one of my first projects done all by myself, that is why I am uploading it to GitHub.
In it I reviewed many concepts that i've been learning like Classes, HTTP requests, SMPT library, API's enpoints calling and a few more.

Hope you like it, and if you have some better ideas (that you'll for sure have), just let me know.
